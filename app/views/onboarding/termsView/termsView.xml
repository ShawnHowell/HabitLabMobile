					<Label textWrap="true" text="Description: HabitLab is a research study on developing better online habits. You can participate by installing and using the HabitLab Android app. The app will ask you to specify some goals (such as spending less time on Facebook), and will deploy various interventions that aim to help you achieve those goals. It will log data related to progress on your goals (such as time spent on domains), which will be used by our algorithms to determine which interventions work for you. Data will not be shared with anyone outside our research team."></Label>
