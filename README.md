Introduction

HabitLabMobile is an app that allows users to design better mobile habits through a two-pronged approach: awareness of usage and
a series of custom alerts. Users select which apps they want to spend less time on, and HabitLab will deploy 'interventions' when
users have surpassed their goal times. 

Features

The main features of the HabitLab app are:

1. Interventions
